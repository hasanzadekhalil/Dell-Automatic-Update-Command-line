#How to use
The update.ps1 file is downloading the 3 files found here. 
Then it runs the downloaded Powershell script in background mode. 
Thus, the user does not see the update window and cannot close it.
The Dell.ps1 powershell file runs the vbs script and after 30 minutes it runs the batch file to update.
